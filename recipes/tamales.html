        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A tamale, in Spanish tamal, is a traditional Mesoamerican dish made of masa, a dough made from nixtamalized corn,
            which is steamed in a corn husk or banana leaves. The wrapping can either be discarded prior to eating or used
            as a plate.</p>

            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano</li>

            <li>3 cups lard</li>

        </ul>

    <div class="tamales-steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place beef and garlic in a large pot. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat,
                cover, and simmer until beef is tender and shreds easily, about 3 1/2 hours. Remove beef from pot, reserving
                5 cups cooking liquid and discarding garlic. Allow meat to cool slightly; shred finely with forks.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place corn husks in a large container and cover with warm water; soak, weighed down with an
                inverted plate and a heavy can, until soft and pliable, about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Toast ancho chiles in a cast iron skillet; cool, then remove stems and seeds. Crumble and grind in a clean
                coffee grinder or with a mortar and pestle.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet; stir in flour and allow to brown slightly. Pour in 1 cup beef broth and stir
                until smooth. Mix in ground chiles, garlic, oregano, cumin seeds, ground cumin, red pepper flakes, vinegar,
                and salt. Stir shredded beef into skillet and cover. Let simmer for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place lard and salt in a large mixing bowl; beat with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy. Add masa
                harina and beat at low speed until well mixed. Pour in reserved cooking liquid, a little at a time, until
                mixture is the consistency of soft cookie dough.</li>
            <li>Drain water from corn husks. One at a time, flatten out each husk, with the narrow end facing you, and
                spread approximately 2 tablespoons masa mixture onto the top 2/3 of the husk. Spread about 1 tablespoon of
                meat mixture down the middle of the masa. Roll up the corn husk starting at one of the long sides. Fold the
                narrow end of the husk onto the rolled tamale and tie with a piece of butchers' twine.</li>
            <li>Place tamales in a steamer basket. Steam over boiling water for approximately one hour, until masa is firm
                and holds its shape, adding more water if needed so the steamer does not boil dry. Serve immediately,
                allowing each person to unwrap their own tamales.</li>
